# Ford-Fulkerson 

! Please refer to the 'Problem Explanation' document for a better understanding of the problem.

I developed a project that read a 'graph.txt' file to create a directed graph using the data in the file. Each line in the file represented an edge in the graph,

with the first column representing the source node, the second column representing the destination node, and the third column representing the weight or capacity

of the edge.

I implemented the graph as a data structure in the code, such as an adjacency list or matrix. After constructing the graph, the program asked the user to input a

source and a destination node for the package transfer.

I used algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum number of packages that can be transferred from the source node 

to the destination node in one day. Additionally, I determined which edges' capacity should be increased first to increase the number of received packages at the 

destination branch.

Overall, my project successfully solved the problem of transferring packages from one branch to another by analyzing and optimizing the directed graph structure.
